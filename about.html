            Hi! I’m a <b>Computer Science student at</b>
            <a
              href="https://www.ciit.edu.ph/"
              class="hover:text-blue-500 font-bold"
              target="_blank"
              >CIIT College of Arts and Technology</a
            >
            with a strong passion for
            <b>
              web development, system administration, and server technologies</b
            >. I enjoy building and managing digital solutions that combine
            performance, security, and scalability.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m also deeply interested in
            <b>
              creating game servers, deploying Dockerized applications, and
              self-hosting various services </b
            >. My long-term goal is to
            <b>build my own game server hosting company</b>
            that provides
            <b
              >low-latency connections, fast and powerful servers, and
              affordable hosting solutions</b
            >
            for gamers and developers alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before college, I studied at <b>STI College Tagaytay</b>, under the
            <b>Mobile App and Web Development (ICT) strand</b>, where I
            developed a solid foundation in programming and web technologies. I
            also had the opportunity to
            <b>participate in local and cluster-level coding competitions</b>,
            which helped me sharpen my problem-solving and teamwork skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m always eager to learn, explore new technologies, and take on
            challenges that push my skills further—especially in the fields of
            <b>server management, containerization, and web infrastructure</b>.
